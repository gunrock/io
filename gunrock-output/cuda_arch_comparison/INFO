Gunrock was always doing launch bound calculations assuming that
CUDA_ARCH=300. This data compares commits before and after changing
this. JSON files are in folders for each dataset and can be
differentiated by their tags:

Gunrock-9c8102fa-before-use-cuda-arch
Gunrock-6ddbd33-after-use-cuda-arch

The data is limited to BFS and SSSP and not all datasets are
used.

Runs were performed on daisy, Tesla V100.
